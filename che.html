        <p>AQI stands for Air Quality Index. It is a numerical scale used to communicate how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecasted to become. The AQI scale typically ranges from 0 to 500, with higher values indicating poorer air quality and an increased potential for adverse health effects.

            The AQI is calculated based on the concentrations of several air pollutants, including:
            
            Ground-level ozone (O3): A major component of smog.
            Particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5): Tiny particles suspended in the air, which can include dust, dirt, soot, and liquid droplets.
            Carbon monoxide (CO): A colorless, odorless gas produced by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels.
            Sulfur dioxide (SO2): A gas produced by the burning of fossil fuels containing sulfur, such as coal and oil.
            Nitrogen dioxide (NO2): A gas produced by combustion processes, including those occurring in vehicles and industrial facilities.
            The AQI provides a way for the public to quickly understand the quality of the air and its potential impact on health. Different countries may have variations in their AQI systems, but the general principle is to categorize air quality into specific bands (such as "Good," "Moderate," "Unhealthy," etc.) to make it easily understandable for the general public.</p>
